The folder FR3DSource contains the Matlab .m and .mat files that are intended for public distribution at rna.bgsu.edu/FR3D.  They are usually more recent than what is actually posted there.  Edit these files carefully, and only add files that are OK for public distribution.

The current FR3D version is contained in zClassLimits.m.
