% zBestTransformation(X,Y) finds the least squares translation and rotation
% of points X onto points Y
%
% X and Y are n by 3 matrices containing the locations of corresponding points
% What is returned is the best fit to Y = shift + scale*X*R'
% R is the 3x3 rotation matrix
% scale is the scalar scale factor
% shift is the 3x1 translation between centers of mass

function [R,scale,shift,sshift] = zBestTransformation(X,Y)

n = length(X(:,1));                 % number of data points

mY = mean(Y);

A = X-ones(n,1)*mX;                 % subtract the mean vector
B = Y-ones(n,1)*mY;                 % subtract the mean vector

R = zBestRotation(A,B);             % find optimal rotation matrix

scale = sqrt(sum(sum(B.*B)) / sum(sum(A.*A)));  % the optimal scale

shift = (mY - mX*R')';           % the optimal shift with no scaling

sshift = (mY - scale*mX*R')';    % the optimal shift when rescaling

% Note: there is no need to calculate and return the optimal scale in our
% applications, since we don't want to rescale.  There should be two versions
% of this program, one with scaling, one without.
